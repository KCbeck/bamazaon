## Overview

In this activity I created an Amazon storefront, like assignment that uses a table that takes in the table then outputs the number of items the cost and the total value.

In this initital screanshot it gives you a table with values to choose, from mock table

once there is a choice made

if the choice is in parameters it will give a valid output. 

this is an example of all parameters being within the numbers.

When the number of the input is too high it will not allow you to hit enter. This is a bad item number.
